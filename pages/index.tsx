              Hey, I am Inga, 29 years old and a recent graduate of the 5th Code
              & Design Camp of DevHaus Leipzig. Before I was half student half
              musician and producer. Corona has changed the lives of many people
              and mine as well. In summer 2019 I decided to give up my studies
              of musicology to focus on making music. During the pandemic my
              plan failed and I felt the urge to learn something completely new.
              And it seems like I did.. what youâ€™re looking at is my first
              website.
            </p>
            <p>I'm currently looking for jobs. Feel free to contact me!</p>
            <div className="flex-container">
              <button>Contact me</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
