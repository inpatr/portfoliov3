            <p>
              Hey, I am Inga, 29 years old and a recent graduate of the 5th Code
              & Design Camp of DevHaus Leipzig. Before that I was half student
              half musician and producer. Corona has changed the lives of many
              people and mine as well. In summer 2019 I decided to give up my
              studies of musicology to focus on making music. During the
              pandemic my plan failed and I felt the urge to learn something
              completely new. And it seems like I did.. what youâ€™re looking at
              is my first website.
            </p>
            <p>I'm currently looking for jobs. Feel free to contact me!</p>
